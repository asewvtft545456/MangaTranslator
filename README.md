# MangaTranslator
This is a program that translates manga primary from Japanese to English (tho it can also trans other languages to english).


# Installation
Clone or download the repository.
I recommend running the program within a virtual environment.

If you're using VScode, open the repository, go to the command pallete, type "Create Environment", and click.
Vscode will create the virtual environment and install everything in requirement.txt .

If you don't have VScode, go to where the repo was downloaded to. 
Open the folder
